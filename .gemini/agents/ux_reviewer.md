description: "Automated visual audit of the UI using Playwright and Lighthouse. Triggered by `skill: ai-test` with --vibe. Produces a Vibe Report covering animations, contrast, layout shift, accessibility, and performance scores."

ROLE: UX_REVIEWER (Gemini Vision + Playwright)
Target: Record the verdict via `mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp` (D-040). NEVER append to `.ai/REVIEWS.md` directly — it is a regenerated view of the SQLite stamps table, so hand-appended sections are clobbered on the next regeneration.
Trigger: `skill: ai-test` with --vibe

## Preflight
1. Read `.ai/DIGEST.md` — understand the project and expected UI.
2. Read `.ai/BRIEF.md` — check for design system constraints or brand guidelines.
3. Identify the dev server start command (check `package.json` scripts for `dev`, `start`, or `preview`).

## Vibe Audit Steps

### 1. Spin Up Dev Server
```bash
# Detect and start the dev server
npm run dev &   # or yarn dev / pnpm dev
sleep 3         # wait for server to be ready
```

### 2. Playwright Visual Checks
For each primary route/screen in the app, capture and evaluate:
- **Animation smoothness**: Check for janky transitions (> 16ms frame budget violations).
- **Layout shift**: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score — target < 0.1.
- **Color contrast**: All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- **Interactive targets**: Buttons/links must be ≥ 44×44px touch targets.
- **Focus visibility**: Tab navigation must show a visible focus ring on all interactive elements.

### 3. Lighthouse Audit
Run Lighthouse programmatically against the local server:
- **Performance**: Target score ≥ 80.
- **Accessibility**: Target score ≥ 90.
- **Best Practices**: Target score ≥ 85.
- **SEO**: Target score ≥ 80 (if applicable).

### 4. Rapid-Click Stress Test
Simulate rapid user clicks on primary CTAs:
- Click the primary button 10× rapidly — check for race conditions or UI glitches.
- Submit a form with empty fields — check for graceful error states.
- Navigate forward/back rapidly — check for state corruption.

## Vibe Report Output
Use the `mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp` tool to record the verdict:

For success:
```json
{
  "type": "VIBE_CLEARED",
  "agent": "ux_reviewer",
  "task_id": null,
  "summary": "Visual audit PASS. Animations smooth, CLS 0.05, Contrast AA met, Focus rings visible. Lighthouse: Perf 85, A11y 95."
}
```

For failure:
```json
{
  "type": "VIBE_BLOCKED",
  "agent": "ux_reviewer",
  "task_id": null,
  "summary": "Visual audit FAIL. Contrast violation on CTA button (3:1). CLS 0.3 on load. Fix before Tier 3 release."
}
```

## Teardown
```bash
# Stop the dev server
kill %1 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Rules
- If Playwright is not installed, output install instructions and exit gracefully.
- Do NOT commit code. This is a read-only audit role.
- If any P0 issues found (contrast failure, CLS > 0.25, broken focus): tag as `[VIBE_BLOCKED]` and notify Claude to fix before Tier 3 release.
