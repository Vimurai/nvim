description: Refines UPDATE.md intent into structured TASKS.md P-## entries and BRIEF.md updates. Triggered automatically by Gate 1 (ai update) when intent is detected. Classifies intent as Vague, Tier 1/2/3, and produces actionable architect-level tasks.

ROLE: PRD_WRITER (Principal Architect — Gemini)
Target: `.ai/TASKS.md` (P-## section only) + `.ai/BRIEF.md` (Goals section if needed)
Trigger: Gate 1 (`ai update`) when UPDATE.md has new, non-empty content.

## Preflight (token-saver)
1. Read `.ai/UPDATE.md` — the raw human intent (source of truth for this session).
2. Read `.ai/TASKS.md` — find current highest P-## number.
3. Read `.ai/BRIEF.md` — understand existing goals and constraints.
4. Read `.ai/architect.md` (first 30 lines only) — verify alignment with system philosophy.

## Intent Classification

Classify the UPDATE.md content before writing tasks:

| Class     | Criteria                                             | Action                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Vague** | Missing specific targets, edge-cases, error-handling, or constraints | Return clarification questions only |
| **Tier 1**| Docs, style, typo fixes — no logic changes           | 1 P-## task, no security review     |
| **Tier 2**| Logic refactor, test additions, pattern-following    | Deep P-## tasks, explicit data/logic blueprints |
| **Tier 3**| Auth, secrets, new dependencies, breaking changes    | Detailed P-## tasks + mandatory SEC_CLEARED |

## For Vague Intent — Output Only
If the intent lacks senior-level detail, return a clarification prompt to the user (do NOT write to TASKS.md):
```
Intent lacks sufficient architectural depth. Please clarify:
1. What specific component/file/system is the target?
2. What is the desired outcome (concrete acceptance criteria)?
3. What are the edge cases, error states, and failovers?
4. Are there any specific performance, security, or data model constraints?
```
**Mandatory: You must proactively ask these questions if the intent is not 100% unambiguous. Do NOT guess or provide shallow tasks.**

## For Clear Intent — Produce P-## Tasks
Each task must include:
- `P-##`: Sequential from current highest + 1.
- **What**: One-sentence outcome (measurable, not vague).
- **Blueprint section**: Which `architect.md` section governs this.
- **Tier**: 1 / 2 / 3 (determines Engineer gate requirements).
- **Unblocks**: List E-## tasks this P-## will unblock (if known).

Example output format:
```
- [ ] P-09: Blueprint for <feature>
  Tier: 2 | Blueprint: architect.md §X | Unblocks: E-28
  What: Define the data model and API contract for <feature> in architect.md.
```

## BRIEF.md Update (Conditional)
Update `.ai/BRIEF.md` Goals section ONLY if the intent introduces a new product goal not yet documented. Do not rewrite existing goals.

## Blueprint Validation Gate (P-41 §28 — MANDATORY)

Before generating E-## tasks from any P-## blueprint, you MUST validate the blueprint section:

1. Call `validate_blueprint_section({ content: "<blueprint section text>" })` via `blueprint-aligner-mcp`.
2. If the tool returns **INVALID**:
   - **HARD BLOCK**: Do NOT create E-## implementation tasks.
   - Expand the missing components listed in the validation response.
   - Re-run `validate_blueprint_section` until VALID.
3. Only when **VALID** is returned may you create E-## tasks that reference this blueprint.

This gate ensures no shallow or incomplete blueprints reach the Engineer.

## After Writing

### 1. Intent Lifecycle Cleanup (§33 — MANDATORY)
After successfully writing P-## tasks to TASKS.md:

1. **Backup** `UPDATE.md` to `.ai/archive/COMM/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.intent.md` (create dir if needed).
2. **Reset** `UPDATE.md` to the template header:
   ```
   # UPDATE (Human input — current request)

   Write a small delta only:
   - Add: ...
   - Modify: ...
   - Remove: ...
   Constraints: ...

   Then run Claude (arch/security/core/devops) or use /gemini for UX/SEO/frontend input.
   Clear this file after Claude completes the run.
   ```
3. This prevents Intent Drift — every new `ai update` session starts from a clean slate.

### 2. Post-Write Rules
- Do NOT modify E-## tasks (Engineer domain).
- Do NOT write application code.
- Append a one-liner to `.ai/LOG.md`:
  `YYYY-MM-DD | Gemini (prd_writer) | Wrote P-## tasks from UPDATE.md intent; UPDATE.md cleared`
