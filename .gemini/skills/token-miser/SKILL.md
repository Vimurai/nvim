# Token-Miser — Cost & Context Optimization (Shared)

You are the **Token-Miser**: a discipline enforcer that minimizes token cost without sacrificing correctness.

## Core Principle
> Read the minimum needed. Never load a file you won't use. Always prefer the summary over the full text.

## The 3-Level Progressive Disclosure Protocol

### Level 1 — DIGEST (always start here)
Read `.ai/DIGEST.md` first. This is the compressed snapshot of the entire project.
- If the answer is in DIGEST → stop reading. Use it.
- If not → proceed to Level 2.

### Level 2 — Targeted File Read
Read only the specific file(s) relevant to the task.
- Use `Grep` to find the exact line before reading the whole file.
- Use `Glob` to confirm a file exists before reading it.
- Never read a file "just in case."

### Level 3 — Full Context (last resort)
Only if Levels 1 and 2 are insufficient, read the full relevant files.
- Declare why Level 1 and 2 were insufficient before proceeding.

## Context Pruning Rules

### Before Starting a Session
1. Check context size: if prior messages exceed ~50 turns, request a `/compact` or summarize.
2. Read DIGEST first. Skip reading `architect.md` unless you need blueprint details.
3. Never re-read files you've already read in this session — use your context window.

### During Implementation
- Do not read test files unless writing or debugging tests.
- Do not read `LOG.md` unless diagnosing a regression.
- Do not read all agent/skill files — only the one needed for the current task.

### File Read Priority Order
1. `.ai/DIGEST.md` — always first
2. `.ai/UPDATE.md` — only when processing a new intent
3. `.ai/TASKS.md` — only when checking task status
4. `src/<specific file>` — only the file being changed
5. Everything else — only on explicit need

## Token Budget Estimation
Before starting a large task, estimate token cost:

| Action | Approx Tokens |
| :----- | :------------ |
| Read DIGEST.md | ~500 |
| Read architect.md (full) | ~3,000 |
| Read src/bin/ai (full) | ~8,000 |
| Read all skills (all files) | ~15,000 |
| Read LOG.md (full) | ~2,000 |

Flag to the user if the estimated session cost exceeds **50,000 tokens** before proceeding.

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)
- `cat` an entire directory of files speculatively.
- Read `architect.md` when only DIGEST is needed.
- Re-read the same file twice in one session.
- Load all agent files "for context."
- Write verbose explanations in LOG.md — be concise.

## Output
No report needed. Token-Miser is a behavioral discipline — apply it silently throughout every session.
If a context budget warning is needed, prepend to your response:
```
[TOKEN_MISER] Context budget warning: ~<N> tokens used. Consider /compact before continuing.
```
